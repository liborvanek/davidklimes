If you're looking for something with much, much more bundled in, check out [my opinionated project base](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template).

## üß≠ Project Status
**This project base will continue to be maintained** [until SvelteKit is ready](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit). 

Once you are prepared to migrate, check out the [Svelte Adders](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-adders) project for information about how to recreate this project base's functionality. You should specifically look at [svelte-add-postcss](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-add-postcss) and [svelte-add-tailwindcss](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-add-tailwindcss).

**Read on to use this project base today:**

## üìã Copy
Choose either to clone or fork depending on your preference.

### üêë Clone
```sh
git clone https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-postcss-template
```

### üç¥ Fork
Click the `Use this template` button on [this project's GitHub page](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-postcss-template).

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install Dependencies
You need to be using version 14.15 or higher of Node.

```sh
cd sapper-postcss-template
npm install  # pnpm also works
```

## üõ† Usage

### üß™ Development
```sh
npm run dev
```

### üî® Building for Production
```sh
npm run prod
```

### üì¶ Exporting a Static Site
```sh
npm run export
```

## ‚öô Configuration

### üí® Optionally removing Tailwind CSS (and PurgeCSS)
1. Remove all Tailwind imports in the `src/global.pcss` file
2. Remove these lines in `postcss.config.js`:
    1. ```js
       const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
       ```
    3. ```js
       const tailwindcssConfig = require("./tailwind.config");
       ```
    3. ```js
       tailwindcss(tailwindcssConfig),
       ```
3. Delete the `tailwind.config.js` file
4. Uninstall the `tailwindcss` package

### ‚ö° Web app
Many of the fields in `static/manifest.json` (`short_name`, `name`, `description`, `categories`, `theme_color`, and `background_color`) are filled with demonstrative values that won't match your site. Similarly, you've got to take new screenshots to replace the included `static/screenshot-1.png` file. If you want, you can add [app shortcut definitions for "add to home screen" on Android](https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/#define-app-shortcuts-in-the-web-app-manifest). Once you change `theme_color`, update the `meta name="theme-color"` tag in `src/template.html` to match.

The [Apple touch icon](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html), favicon, and `logo-` files (also all in the `static` directory) are created by placing the logo within a "safe area" centered circle that takes up 80% of the canvas's dimension. For instance, the constraining circle in `logo-512.png` is 512 √ó 0.80 = 409.6 ‚âà 410 pixels wide and tall. 

### üó∫ Source maps
This project base comes with [source maps](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps) enabled during development and disabled during production (and exports) for the best compromise between performance and developer experience. You can change this behavior through the `sourcemap` variable in `rollup.config.js`.
